Using Simplicit&eacute;&reg; server image
=========================================

Introduction
------------

This repository contains tools to build **server** [Docker](http://www.docker.com) images that contains a pre-configured
[Tomcat](http://tomcat.apache.org/) or [TomEE](http://tomee.apache.org) server on which you can run
a [Simplicit&eacute;&reg;](http://www.simplicitesoftware.com) low code platform instance.

The images built using these tools are available on [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/simplicite/server/)

Pull image
----------

You can pull an server image by:

	sudo docker pull simplicite/server[:tag]

See [DockerHub page](https://hub.docker.com/r/simplicite/server/) for details on available tags.

Add an instance
---------------

There are two approaches to run Simplicit&eacute; platform using these server images:

### Build a custom image

To add a Simplicit&eacute;&reg; platform instance to the server image you need to create an image from the server image:

	vi Dockerfile

With this content:

```
FROM simplicite/server
ADD <path to your Simplict&eacute;&reg; webapp> /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/ROOT
```

> **Note**: the above path must be inside the build directory

Then you can build your instance's image by:

	sudo docker build -t simplicite/<my application name> .

And run it

### Use external Git repository

You can directly mount a template Git repository into your server container (see bellow).

Exposed ports
-------------

The images are configured to exposes the following ports for different usage:

- Tomcat HTTP port `8080` for direct access or to be exposed thru an HTTP reverse proxy (Apache, NGINX, ...)
- Tomcat HTTP port `8443` to be exposed thru an HTTPS reverse proxy (Apache, NGINX, ...)
- Tomcat AJP port `8009` to be exposed thru an HTTP/HTTPS reverse proxy (Apache)
- Tomcat admin port `8005` for starting/stopping Tomcat from outside of the container
- Tomcat JPDA port `8000` for remote debugging Tomcat (needs Tomcat to be (re)started with the `jpda` keyword)

Run
---

### Sandbox mode

Run the container in sandbox mode with an embedded database by:

	sudo docker run [-it --rm | -d] -p <public port, e.g. 8080>:8080 [-p <secured HTTP port, e.g. 8443>:8443] [-p <AJP port, e.g. 8009>:8009] [-p <admin port, e.g. 8005>:8005] [-e JPDA=true -p <JPDA port, e.g. 8000>:8000] simplicite/<server | my application name>[:tag]

### Standard mode

You can also run the container in standard mode with an external database by adding these arguments to the above run command:

	-e DB_SETUP=<setup database if empty = true|false>
	-e DB_VENDOR=<database vendor = mysql|postgresql|oracle|mssql>
	-e DB_HOST=<hostname or IP address>
	-e DB_PORT=<port, defaults to 3306 for mysql, 5432 for postgresql, 1521 for oracle or 1433 for mssql>
	-e DB_USER=<database username>
	-e DB_PASSWORD=<database username's password>
	-e DB_NAME=<database name>

### Using a template Git repository

In this case you can directly run a **server image** either with:

- `-v <path to the template Git repository>:/usr/local/template:ro` to read-only mount the template repository located **outside** of the container
- `-e GIT_URL=<Git URL of the template repository>` to clone the template repository **inside** the container
  (optionaly you can specify a branch with `-e GIT_BRANCH=<branch name>` otherwise the default `master` branch is used)

When starting for the first time, the container will create the webapp from the template repository (after cloning it when it is located inside the container).
Then, at each restart, it will upgrade the webapp from the template repository (after pulling it when it is located inside the container).

### Others

You can force the timezone of the application server by using `-e TOMCAT_TIMEZONE=<timezone, e.g. Europe/paris>`

You can adjust any other required JVM options by using `-e JAVA_OPTS="<other JVM options, e.g. -Xms...>"`

If you experience network issues within your container it is likely to be a DNS configuration issue
that you can solve by adding `--dns=8.8.8.8` to your run command above.
